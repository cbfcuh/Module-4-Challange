The task of this challange to was create a personal blog that was done over two webpages. One page consisting for a form format where the user is prompted to enter: "Username", "Blog Title" and "Content" once these are filled out and submitted the data is stored locally and the second webpage is loaded. On the second webpage the data that was locally stored will be called upon and displayed structurally.<br>During this challange I gained a greater understanding on how to utlise Javascript functions and the importance of manipulating DOM while simultaneously storing and retrieving data correctly. Also I also learnt the basic of creating a webpage that was capable of switching between light and dark modes.

# Installations
This blogs start code can be found on my personal<a href="https://github.com/cbfcuh/Module-4-Challange">Github </a>profile. Feel free to download the starter code and improve it to your liking.

# Challanges
Some of the biggest challanges I personally faced during this challange was 
<li>Remembering to push the data that was being stored</li>
<li>Correctly giving unique identifiers, I had "id" that were quite similar in name and found myself calling the wrong ones</li>

# Improvements
This blog is currently far from perfect and a lot can be done to improve it:
<li>Visually the blog is very lackluster, colour and contrast could be added to improve the UX</li>
<li>Rather than having the light/dark mode as a simple checkbox, it could be styled into a slider-bar instead giving it a more interactive feel</li>
<li>Having it so that once changed over to dark mode and the user reloads the webpage that it remains in the dark mode rather going back to light mode.</li>
